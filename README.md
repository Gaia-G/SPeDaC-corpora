# SPeDaC-corpora
Two labeled dataset for sensitive personal data detection
Here we uploaded the two SPeDaC corpora. The first dataset (SPeDaC1) concerns sensitive and non sensitive sentences. The second one (SPeDaC2) represents personal data categories (PDCs) from DPV-PD (https://w3c.github.io/dpv/dpv-pd/) classifying it with 5 macro-categories labels (SpecialData, Financial&Tracking, Internal, External and Social). Every corpus is splitted into training, validation and test set, in order to compare the experimental results we have previously achieved with future results.

In SPeDaC2 you can find also a fine-grained dataset of 5562 sentences labeled with the 74 personal data categories.

The annotations are sentence-level and in WebAnno TSV v3.3 format.
