# SPeDaC-corpora

The first dataset (SPeDaC1) concerns sensitive and non sensitive sentences. The second one (SPeDaC2) represents personal data categories (PDCs) from DPV-PD (https://w3c.github.io/dpv/dpv-pd/) classifying it with 5 macro-categories labels (SpecialData, Financial&Tracking, Internal, External and Social). Every corpus is splitted into training, validation and test set, in order to compare the experimental results we have previously achieved with future results.
